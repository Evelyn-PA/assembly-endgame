# 🚀 Assembly: Endgame

Welcome to **Assembly: Endgame!**  
This is a word‑guessing game where you must guess the secret word in under **8 attempts** to keep the programming world safe from Assembly!

I built this project as part of my self‑study journey to sharpen my React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills.
